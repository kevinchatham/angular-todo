# Applying Migrations To Client
Whenever you make changes to your Prisma schema in the future, you manually need to invoke prisma generate in order to accommodate the changes in your Prisma Client API.
```
npx prisma generate
```

# DB Viewer and Editor
```
npx prisma studio
```

# ESLint
```
npm install eslint --save-dev

npx eslint --init
```
